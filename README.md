# keyrot
brainrot "keylogger". checks if input string matches some pre-specified internet meme, displays the associated meme in fullscreen, and plays a sound.

## Usage
Compile using make:

```shell
make all
```

then run:

```shell
./keyrot
```

At this moment, it only works with input in the specified terminal. Still working on properly grabbing all keyboard input from X11/Wayland.
